I want to learn more about deep learning and I am taking this into my hands by making this project where I will experiment with music composition using different arquitectures.


###Roadmap:


  - ~~Initial Data Collection~~
  - Encode midi files into a more ML friendly encoding
  - Train AWDLSTM
  - Train Transformer model
  - Gather More Data (Web scrapping, datasets etc...)
  - Fine Tune
