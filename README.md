I want to learn more about deep learning and I am taking this into my hands by making this project where I will experiment with music composition using different arquitectures.


### Roadmap:


  - ~~Initial Data Collection~~
  - ~~Read midi files into csv/dataframe~~
  - ~~Encode notes into tokens with information~~
  - ~~Make encoded dataframe into string representing the music piece~~
  - ~~Generalize process~~
  - ~~Speed up preprocessing with parell processing~~
  - ~~Make function to translate string into midi~~
  - Train AWD-LSTM at first
  - Train Transformer model
  - Gather More Data (Web scrapping, datasets etc...)
  - Fine Tune
