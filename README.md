I want to learn more about deep learning and I am taking this into my hands by making this project where I will experiment with music composition using different arquitectures.


### Roadmap:


  - ~~Initial Data Collection~~
  - ~~Read midi files into csv/dataframe~~
  - Encode midi files into a more ML friendly encoding
  - Train AWD-LSTM at first
  - Train Transformer model
  - Gather More Data (Web scrapping, datasets etc...)
  - Fine Tune
